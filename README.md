## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- grid-template-areas (css)
- In styled-components, I learned to change the background color of the body according to the theme (Global Style)


### Continued development

I'm still lacking in making responsive design, so I'm going to do some more projects to make up for that. And I'll study React performance improvement (life cycle).

### Useful resources

- [grid-template-areas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas) - It helped me to have a responsive design in a box showing user information
